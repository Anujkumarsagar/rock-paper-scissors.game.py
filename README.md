# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This is a simple Python implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game. The game is played against a computer opponent that makes random choices, and the player is asked to input their choice. The game provides the outcome (Win, Lose, or Tie) and keeps track of the player's score.

## How to Play

1. Run the Python script.
2. You will be prompted to input your choice: "Rock," "Paper," or "Scissors."
3. The computer will make a random choice.
4. The game will determine the winner and display the result.
5. You will have the option to see your current score or play another round.

## Rules

- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock

## Functions

- `select(random_pass, user)`: This function takes two arguments, the random choice made by the computer and the user's choice. It compares the choices to determine the outcome of the round and updates the user's score. The function returns the user's score.

- The game will continue until you choose to exit.

## Note

- The user's score is displayed after each round.
